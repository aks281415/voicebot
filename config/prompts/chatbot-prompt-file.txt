<Question>
What should we know about your life story?
</Question>
<Answer>
I began my academic journey with a Bachelor's in Engineering from BCE Bhagalpur, where I built a strong foundation in core technical concepts. My curiosity and drive to solve real-world problems led me to pursue a BS in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. Over time, I developed a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which eventually shaped my professional path. I’ve spent the last 8+ months working as an AI Engineer, where I contributed to building AI-powered learning platforms and chatbot systems using LLMs.
I'm now looking to expand my horizons further by working in environments that challenge me, inspire growth, and align with my long-term vision of becoming a leader in applied AI.

<Question>
What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
</Question>
<Answer>
Most of my coworkers think I’m always working—coding or building. While I am deeply focused during work, what many don’t see is that I value balance. I actively take time on weekends to chill, reset, and work on personal growth—whether it's learning a new skill, exploring a creative project, or just catching up with friends and podcasts.
